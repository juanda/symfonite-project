symfonite-project
=================

A symfony project linked to the symfonite plugins

Installation
------------

Inside a directory within the *DocumentRoot* of your web server:

* git clone git://github.com/juanda/symfonite-project.git .
* git submodule init
* git submodule update

That's all. Now you have an empty symfony-1.4 project with the symfonite extension
plugged. In order to know what you can do with this, you should follow the tutorial:

http://ntic.educacion.es/desarrollo/docs/sft/tutoriales/tutorial-1.html

from the 3th point (the precedents say how to deploy the framework from a tgz file)

However in order to know something more about *symfonite* we recommend to take a look at
the *symfonite* site:

http://ntic.educacion.es/desarrollo/symfonite/

Note: At this moment the documentation is available only in spanish :-(.
The tutorial source (in *rst* format) is available in ``docs`` directory
of this project.
